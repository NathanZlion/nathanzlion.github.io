Software Engineer & Musician ðŸŽµ

Hi, Iâ€™m Nathnael Dereje, a fifth-year Software Engineering student at Addis Ababa Institute of Technology. Iâ€™m passionate about building scalable, efficient, and impactful software solutions while also finding joy in creating music on the piano, keyboard, and guitar.

My journey into software engineering started in high school, and over the years, Iâ€™ve expanded my expertise into full-stack development, distributed systems, and AI. I work extensively with Go, Python, TypeScript, React, Angular, and FastAPI, focusing on writing clean, maintainable, and efficient code.

Beyond personal projects, Iâ€™m deeply involved in algorithmic problem-solving on platforms like LeetCode and Codeforces, which led me to A2SVâ€”a program that has strengthened my technical skills and collaboration abilities. Iâ€™ve also taken on leadership roles, mentoring aspiring engineers and contributing to tech education across Africa.

Iâ€™m currently looking for internship and full-time opportunities where I can apply my skills to meaningful projects, tackle complex engineering challenges, and continue growing as a developer. If youâ€™re looking for someone who loves both solving tough problems and writing elegant code, letâ€™s connect!
